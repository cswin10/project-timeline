## Pitch Strategy

### Opening (Core System):
> "I've built an AI timeline estimator trained on YOUR data. 30-second estimates, 90% accuracy, £350/month."

### Upgrade #1 (Team Size):
> "We can also show multiple timeline options - Standard, Fast-Track, Premium. Lets you charge 15-30% more for faster service. One customer choosing premium pays for the whole system."

### Upgrade #2 (Building Age - FREE):
> "And it handles period properties correctly - detects Victorian, flags asbestos, adjusts for lath & plaster. Since you specialize in older buildings, this is crucial. It's included free."

### Upgrade #3 (Customer Tool - BIG CLOSER):
> "But here's where it gets really interesting: we can put this on your website for CUSTOMERS to use. They upload plans, get instant estimates, you get qualified leads. It's like having a salesperson working 24/7. Competitors make customers call and wait. You give instant answers. That's a massive competitive advantage."

### The Close:
> "So here's what I propose:
>
> **Month 1:** Core system (£3,000 setup + £350/month)
> - 30-day pilot, money-back guarantee
> - Building age detection included
> - Test with your internal estimates
>
> **Month 2:** Add team size tiers (£500)
> - Enable premium pricing
> - Upsell fast-track service
>
> **Month 4:** Launch customer tool (£1,000)
> - Put it on your website
> - Start generating passive leads
> - One customer/month pays for everything
>
> Total: £4,500 over 4 months + £360/month ongoing
>
> But ROI is clear: You'll save £1,500/month on estimation time, charge premium for fast-track service, and generate 20+ qualified leads/month. This pays for itself in month one, then it's pure profit.
>
> Want to start with the pilot?"

## Closing Questions

### To Gauge Interest:
1. "How valuable would it be to give customers instant estimates on your website?"
2. "What percentage of customers would you charge extra for faster timelines?"
3. "How much time do you currently spend on estimates that don't convert?"

### To Address Concerns:
1. "What's your biggest worry about a tool like this?"
2. "What would make this a no-brainer for you?"
3. "If this generated 5 extra projects/month, would that be worth it?"

### To Close:
1. "Do you want to start with just the internal tool, or include the customer-facing version from day one?"
2. "Would you prefer to pay everything upfront or spread over 4 months?"
3. "Any reason NOT to start the 30-day pilot today?"

---

2. Premium pricing capability (£15-30k/year)
3. Lead generation machine (£240k+/year)
4. Competitive advantage (priceless)

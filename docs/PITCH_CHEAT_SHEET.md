# SILVERFERN MEETING - QUICK REFERENCE

## THE PITCH (30 seconds)
> "I've built an AI system that analyzes architectural drawings and generates accurate project timelines in 30 seconds. It's trained on YOUR company's data, so it estimates based on how YOUR team actually works - not generic industry standards. You'll save 2-3 hours per estimate and achieve 90%+ accuracy."

## OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

**"Not sure about accuracy"**
→ "That's why we have the 30-day pilot with money-back guarantee. Plus it learns from YOUR data, so accuracy improves to 90%+."

**"What if we cancel?"**

## Objection Handling

### "That's expensive"
→ Compare to manual labor cost: £1,000-3,000/month in estimator time
→ ROI is achieved in first 1-2 months
→ Annual savings: £8,000-36,000

### "What if it's not accurate?"
→ 30-day pilot with money-back guarantee
→ System improves with their data over time
→ 85-95% accuracy achievable after calibration

### "We already have a system"
→ Is it trained on YOUR data or generic?
→ Does it analyze actual drawings or just input numbers?
→ Does it improve over time?

### "Can we just buy the software outright?"
→ Explain SaaS model benefits: updates, support, infrastructure
→ Offer annual payment discount (2 months free)
→ One-time purchase would be £50,000+ (not practical)

### "What if we want to cancel?"
→ 30-day notice, no penalties after minimum period
→ Data is yours to export
→ Only lose the tool, not the insights gained

---

## Closing Strategy

### The Ask:
> "Based on what you've seen, I recommend the Professional tier at £350/month with a £3,000 setup fee. You'll save £1,500+ per month compared to manual estimation, achieve 90%+ accuracy within 3 months, and have a competitive advantage no other builder in your area has.
>
> We can start with a 30-day pilot - you only pay the setup fee, first month is free. If you're not impressed with the accuracy and time savings, I'll refund your setup fee. Deal?"

### Success Metrics to Highlight:
- **30 seconds** per estimate (vs 2-3 hours)
- **90%+ accuracy** after calibration (vs 70% manual)

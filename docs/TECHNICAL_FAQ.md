# Technical FAQ - For Client Questions

## "How does the AI actually work?"

**Simple Answer:**
"It uses GPT-4 Vision - the same AI technology that powers ChatGPT, but specialized for analyzing images. It 'reads' architectural drawings like an experienced estimator would, identifying rooms, measuring spaces, and noting complexity. Then it applies rules based on YOUR company's historical data to generate accurate timelines."

**If they want more detail:**
"The AI is trained on millions of images, so it can recognize architectural drawings, floor plans, and construction details. When you upload a drawing, it extracts room counts, estimates square footage, identifies features like bathrooms and kitchens, and notes structural complexity. Then it uses mathematical rules we configure based on your historical project data to calculate realistic timelines."

---

## "Is our data secure?"

**Answer:**
"Absolutely. Your data is stored in a private database that's completely isolated from other clients. We use bank-level encryption (SSL), regular backups, and you control who has access. The system is GDPR compliant, and you own 100% of your data - you can export it anytime. The AI processes your drawings but doesn't store them long-term unless you want to."

---

## "What if the AI makes a mistake?"

**Answer:**
"The AI generates estimates based on YOUR historical data, so accuracy improves over time as we track actual outcomes. Initially, we aim for 85-90% accuracy. If estimates are off, we analyze why and adjust the rules. That's why we track estimated vs. actual durations - to continuously improve. Plus, you always review the estimate before sending it to clients, so you're in control."

---

## "Can we customize it?"

**Answer:**
"100% yes. The entire system is configured around YOUR company's way of working:
- Your baseline duration ranges (from historical data)
- Your team size and capabilities
- Your project types and specializations
- Your branding (logo, colors, fonts)
- Your terminology and descriptions

It's not one-size-fits-all - it's built specifically for Silverfern."

---

## "What happens if it goes down?"

**Answer:**
"The system is hosted on enterprise-grade infrastructure (Vercel and Supabase) with 99.9% uptime guarantee. There's automatic redundancy and failover, so if one server has issues, another takes over instantly. We have real-time monitoring, and if there's any downtime, we're alerted immediately. In the unlikely event of an outage, we'll have you back up within minutes."

---

## "How long does setup take?"

**Answer:**
"Two weeks from the day you provide your historical data:
- Week 1: Data analysis and system configuration
- Week 2: White-label deployment, testing, and training
- Day 15: Go live

The longest part is usually gathering the historical project data on your end. Once we have that, we move fast."

---

## "What data do you need from us?"

**Answer:**
"We need information from 20-30 completed projects:
1. Project details (size, room count, type)
2. Actual duration for each phase (demolition, first fix, etc.)
3. Any factors that affected timing (access issues, structural surprises, etc.)
4. Your team structure (how many crews, average size)

We'll send you a simple spreadsheet template to fill out. Usually takes 2-3 hours to compile."

---

## "Can we integrate it with our existing systems?"

**Answer:**
"Yes, through API access (available in Enterprise tier). We can integrate with:
- Your project management software
- CRM systems
- Existing estimation tools
- Client portals

For most clients, the white-label web app is enough, but if you want deeper integration, we can do custom work."

---

## "What if our process changes?"

**Answer:**
"That's the beauty of the system - it's flexible. If your team gets faster, adds crews, or changes how you work, we simply update the rules. Takes about 30 minutes. Your monthly fee includes ongoing optimization, so we adjust as your business evolves."

---

## "How does it handle unusual projects?"

**Answer:**
"The AI learns to recognize patterns. For unusual projects (loft conversions, basements, listed buildings), we add specific rules based on your experience with those. The more unusual projects you complete, the better it gets at estimating them. Initially, for rare project types, you might need to manually adjust the estimate."

---

## "What format are the estimates in?"

**Answer:**
"You get two things:
1. An on-screen breakdown showing all phases, durations, assumptions, and risk factors
2. A professional PDF report you can download and send to clients

The PDF is branded with your logo and looks like a premium service document - builds client trust."

---

## "Can multiple people use it?"

**Answer:**
"Yes, depending on your tier:
- Starter: 1 user
- Professional: 5 users
- Enterprise: Unlimited users

Each user has their own login, and you can control permissions (who can upload, who can only view, etc.)."

---

## "What if we want to cancel?"

**Answer:**
"You can cancel anytime after the 3-month minimum commitment. Just give us 30 days notice. There are no penalties or early termination fees. Your data is yours - you can export it before canceling. We'll delete your data within 30 days if you request it, or we can keep it archived for 6 months in case you want to reactivate."

---

## "How much does each estimate cost?"

**Answer:**
"There's no per-estimate cost - it's unlimited within your tier:
- Starter: Up to 50/month
- Professional: Up to 150/month
- Enterprise: Unlimited

So whether you do 1 estimate or 150, you pay the same monthly fee. This encourages you to use it for everything, which improves accuracy."

---

## "Can we try it before committing?"

**Answer:**
"Absolutely. We offer a 30-day pilot program:
- You pay the setup fee (£3,000)
- First month is FREE
- Test it with real projects
- If you're not satisfied, we refund the setup fee in full
- If you love it, monthly billing starts after 30 days

This way you can validate the ROI with zero risk."

---

## "What makes this better than [competitor]?"

**Answer:**
"Most estimation software is just a calculator - you input room counts and it multiplies by fixed rates. This system:
1. Actually READS the drawings (AI vision)
2. Is trained on YOUR data, not generic industry standards
3. Learns and improves over time
4. Generates professional client-facing reports
5. Is white-labeled as YOUR tool, not ours

You're not buying off-the-shelf software - you're getting a custom AI system built around your business."

---

## "Do we need technical knowledge to use it?"

**Answer:**
"No. It's as simple as:
1. Upload a drawing (drag and drop)
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Download PDF

That's it. The only 'technical' part is initial setup, which we handle. Your team just needs to know how to upload a file - if they can use email attachments, they can use this."

---

## "What about updates and new features?"

**Answer:**
"All included in your monthly fee. When we add new features (better accuracy, new project types, enhanced reports, etc.), you get them automatically. No extra charges, no complicated upgrades. The software is always improving in the background."

---

## "Can we see it working on our actual projects?"

**Answer:**
"Yes! Bring a few floor plans to this meeting and I'll run them through right now. Or, after you sign up, we'll test it on 3-5 of your completed projects during setup to validate accuracy before you go live."

---

## "What if the AI can't read a drawing?"

**Answer:**
"GPT-4 Vision is very robust - it can handle sketches, photos of plans, CAD exports, even hand-drawn diagrams. In rare cases where a drawing is too unclear (very poor photo quality, unreadable text), it will tell you it needs a better image. This happens in less than 1% of cases. You can always retake the photo or clean up the scan."

---

## "How accurate is 'accurate'?"

**Answer:**
"With proper calibration using your historical data, we achieve:
- 85-90% accuracy immediately after setup
- 90-95% accuracy after 3 months of tracking outcomes
- 95%+ accuracy after 6+ months

'Accurate' means the actual project duration falls within the estimated range (min-max days) 9 times out of 10."

---

## "What's the catch?"

**Answer:**
"There isn't one. This is legitimate SaaS (Software as a Service) with clear pricing. The 'catch' is:
1. You need to provide historical data for calibration (takes time)
2. There's a 3-month minimum commitment (so we can prove ROI)
3. The more you track outcomes, the better it gets (requires discipline)

But there are no hidden fees, no upsells, no long-term contracts. Just a fair monthly fee for a powerful tool."
